<html><head></head><body><p>At it&#39;s core, Verse distinguishes between two types of text -- text which isn&#39;t marked up, and text which is.</p><p>Marked up text is associated with the name of a transformation to be applied. These transformations can range from being extremely simple text substitutions, to something far more complex.</p><p>At the simpler end of things, we have the basic HTML transformations, like <strong>bold text</strong>, as well as <em>italicized text</em>. These are rendered almost through simple text substitution, so they aren&#39;t that difficult to write.</p><p>But at the <strong>end</strong> of the <em>day</em>, there&#39;s only <em>so much</em> you can do with <strong>just</strong> these.</p></body></html>
