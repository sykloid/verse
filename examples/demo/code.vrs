Since the renderer is stacked on top of IO, you can technically do anything you want. For example,
you can call out to an arbitrary command and ask it to do some rendering for you.

One such task I've done many times, is to ask {italics|Pygments} to do syntax highlighting for me.
With just a few lines of code, I can now insert type signatures like:

{code|haskell:map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]}

You can also do other languages, like:

{code|cpp:void swap(int& x, int& y);}
